    <h1>Kinematics</h1>
    <p>Kinematics is a branch of physics where the motion of objects is studied- how fast it moves, the direction, how long it takes. Before you start learning, there are some terms you need to be familiar with: </p>
    <ul>
        <li style="color:  rgba(225, 250, 250);
">Position: Where an object is relative to a reference point.</li>
        <li style="color:aliceblue (225, 250, 250);
">Velocity: "The rate of change in direction", or in normal words, how fast something is moving and in what direction.</li>
        <li style="color:  rgba(225, 250, 250) ;
">Acceleration: "The rate of change of velocity", or again, how quickly an objecting is speeding up or speeding down, and changing directions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Distance vs Displacment</h4>
    <p>Say you're cycling from one place to another, and you take a long detour. Distance would be how long the actual path you traveled through is, including all the extra streets and blocks. Displacment is how far you've actually gotten from where you started out, just a straight path from where you started out and where you ended at. Here's a question for you- if you take a flight from exactly where you are right now, and travel all the way around the globe, ending up where you started from, what would your displacment be? </p>
  
<p>Try drawing a random path on the following grid and watching the difference between the distance and displacement values for the motion.</p>

<section id="distance-displacement" class="sim-section">
  <h2 style="font-family: 'press start 2p';">Distance vs Displacement</h2>

  <div class="sim-container">
    <canvas id="canvas" width="800" height="500"></canvas>

    <div class="panel">
      <div id="distance">Distance: 0 m</div>
      <div id="displacement">Displacement: 0 m</div>

      <button onclick="playPath()">Play</button>
      <button onclick="resetPath()">Reset</button>

      <p class="hint">
        Distance depends on the path.  
        Displacement depends only on start and end.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>


    <h4>Speed vs Velocity</h4>
    <p>Speed tells you how fast you're moving, and velocity is both how fast youre going and what direction youre moving in. So, if you're moving with the same speed, but you're turning as you do, your speed would be constant, but your velocity would not. </p>

<h4>Acceleration</h4>

<p>Try out different values of acceleration and play the animation to see how it affects velocity. </p>

<section class="sim-section">
  <h2>Acceleration</h2>

  <div class="sim-container">
    <canvas id="accelCanvas" width="900" height="300"></canvas>

    <div class="panel">
      <div>Acceleration: <span id="accelVal">0</span> m/s²</div>

      <input
        type="range"
        id="accelSlider"
        min="-2"
        max="2"
        step="0.1"
        value="0"
      />

      <button onclick="togglePlay()">Play / Pause</button>
      <button onclick="resetMotion()">Reset</button>

      <p class="hint">
        Acceleration changes velocity — not position directly.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>


<p>This animation demonstrates how constant acceleration affects velocity and position. Try out different values for initial velocity, acceleration, and time and press play to see how it changes and affects motion. </p>

<h3>Motion Graphs</h3>
<p>Motion graphs are used to visualise and understand the motion happening. There are three main types of graphs used in kinematics: position-time, velocity-time and acceleration-time.
</p>
<p>Position time graphs are used to show how an object's position changes with respect to time. The position lies on the y-axis, and time lies on the x-axis. These graphs can be used to calculate the average (change in position by change in time) and instantaneous velocity (slope of the tangent to that point).
</p>
<p>Velocity time graphs show an object's velocity changes over time. But there's more to them. Using a v-t graph, we can also find the displacement (graph's area) and the acceleration of the object (graph's slope).
</p>
<p>Acceleration time graphs show the change in an object's acceleration over a period of time. 
</p>
<p>Use the graph below to understand how these three different types of graphs relate to each other. In this simulation you adjust the shape of a Velocity vs. Time graph by sliding points up or down. Watch how the graphs of Position vs. Time and Acceleration vs. Time change as they adjust to match the motion shown on the Velocity vs. Time graph.
